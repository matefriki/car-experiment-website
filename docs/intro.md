# Car Experiment Visualizer
The car-experiment-website is an experimental visualizer for the trace generated by an MDP model of a simple world. This world is made up of a car agent, a pedestrian, and several static elements that influence their behavior, such as a crosswalk and a zone of decreased visibility (as might be expected to result from various real world obstacles like other cars). The website provides an interface for editing the initial state of this model (starting position of the car, pedestrian, etc.), and simulating a possible outcome. All model checking functionality, which involves two external programs, is handled automatically by the connected server. The resulting trace is displayed by the web interface as a stylized 2d animation. 

## Design Choices
Information regarding the general structure of the client and server, as well as the tool choices made, can be found [here](design.md).

## Maintenance
Found below are several guides that further explain the functionality of the interface program, as well as its supporting scripts.
